 ```
 ~$ E:\
 ~$ cd LenovoAuction

 - Now we need to download all the dependencies required to run the script. For this we will type below command in terminal:

 ```
 ~$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```


<!-- Understanding File -->
## Understanding Project File

#### Data Folder üö´
All outpoutl files will be stored in this folder.

#### requirement.txt üö´
This file contains all the dependencies that we need to install on our system. You can delete this file but its Ok to keep it there and forget that it exists.

#### script.py üö´
This file is the main script that we need to run to get the desired output. **Please never touch this file**.

#### selectors.config üö´
This file contains all the selectors for different elements nodes from which data is fetched. **Please never touch this file**.

#### chomedriver.exe ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is a chome webdriver. This is version 88.0.4324.146 and is supported by MacOs. In case you have different version of Chrome installed in your system or you have OS other than MacOs then, please replace it with the one that you will get [from here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Make sure you download the driver that supports your OS and have same version as that of chrome installed on your system.

#### config.json ‚úçÔ∏è
This file needs to be edited everytime you run the script and so it needs some explation...

 - **base_url** => base url of the website *No Need to edit this*.

 - **auction_and_lot_details** => List of details of auction and lot number that are to be scrapped.

 - **strip_part_number** => Describes the format of Part Number. If *true* then script will remove any text in parenthesis ‚Äì for example it will remove ‚Äú(SN:276354-56)‚Äù and ‚Äú(276354-56)‚Äù.

 - **output** =>  This is the format in which output is required. It can have a value of *excel* or *csv*.

 - **Processor** =>  This is the list of word which allows script to determine if the value belongs to *processor* category. Please add any word if require.

 - **Memory** =>  This is the list of word which allows script to determine if the value belongs to *memory* category. Please add any word if require.

 - **Storage** =>  This is the list of word which allows script to determine if the value belongs to *storage* category. Please add any word if require.

 - **Part** =>  This is the list of word which allows script to determine if the value belongs to *part number* category. Please add any word if require.


<!-- Running the script -->
## Running The Script
 So before running the script please make sure of two things:

 - You have edited the config file properly.
 - The pointer in terminal is pointing to the project forlder. If not then use below code:

 ```
 ~$ E:\
 ~$ cd LenovoAuction
 ```

Now we need to enter below code to execute the script.

```
~$ python3 script.py
```

Now just grab yourself a pint of üç∫ and let the script do its task.
